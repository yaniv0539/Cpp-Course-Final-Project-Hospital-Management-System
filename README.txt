Comments:
-->Hard-coded patients and visits applies only when data.txt doesn't exists.
   As assigned to us, patients and their info wasn't saved to text file.

-->In loading functions from file, we prefered efficiency over maintenance
   by not using the addDepartment function and creating another copy.

-->Array is used in class Researcher.

Algorithm functions usage (At least 2):
find_if --> Department.cpp - Search functions for patients and doctors.
for_each --> Department.cpp - Show functions for doctors, nurses and patients.
